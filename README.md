# Todo App written functionally with data and business logic first

So many times we think ok I have this idea I want to build it but then we start thinking I am going to use this framework. I am going to use this database. I am going to build some awesome "insert framework" frontend with some great "insert framework or tool" backend. What that does though is makes us solve the problem with those constraints. If we are going to store stuff i na database we might start thinking about the database domain.

Do take this the wrong way frameworks and databases are amazing things but what if you write programs with the data model and business logic first and then add those other things later. Making sure your business logic and data mobel will work without all that first.
